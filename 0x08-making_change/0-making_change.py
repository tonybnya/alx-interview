Given a pile of coins of different values,
determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

- Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
- Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`
    - If `total` is `0` or less, return `0`
    - If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`
- `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
- The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`
- You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin
  in the list
- Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task

Examples:

    >>> coins = [1, 2, 25]
    >>> total = 37
    >>> print(makeChange(coins, total))
    >>> 7
    >>>
    >>> coins = [1256, 54, 48, 16, 102]
    >>> total = 1453
    >>> print(makeChange(coins, total))
    >>> -1
