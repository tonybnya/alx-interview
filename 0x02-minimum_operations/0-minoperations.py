Minimum Operations

In a text file, there is a single character H.
Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file:
Copy All and Paste.
Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number
of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

- Prototype: def minOperations(n)
- Returns an integer
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Examples:
    >>> n = 9
    >>> minOperations(n)
    >>> 6

    >>> n = 4
    >>> minOperations(n)
    >>> 4

    >>> n = 12
    >>> minOperations(n)
    >>> 7

def minOperations(n):

    Function that calculates the minimum number of operations.

    Args:
        n (int): an integer as number of H to write
    Returns:
